                    <p>It started with five acres of land located just east of the Hudson River in Kinderhook, New York. In 1987, the Hoyt brothers, Harold and Hoss, left city life in Brooklyn behind to start working and making a living from the land.</p>
                    <p>Over the past three decades the Hoyt brothers have turned their humble vegetable farm into a 100 acre farm specialzing in hundreds of varieties of organic fruits, vegetables, and livestock, including chickens, pigs, and goats.</p>
                    <p>Our mission and promise to you at Hoyt Farms is to grow the highest quality products for our neighbors.</p>

                    <p>At Hoyt Farms, we grow hundreds of varieties of different fruits and vegetables. We are committed to growing organic, specialty, and heirloom varieties that thrive here in the Northeast. We grow many exotic colors of traditional vegetables
                        that we grow that will give you a great mix of vitamins and phytonutrients. Our vegetables taste different than those you will find in the supermarket and even those that you purchase locally from conventional growers. As a certified
                        organic farm, we pay special attention to the quality and health of our soil and water which directly affects the health, taste, and beauty of our produce.</p>
